## 🧠 Objective
Analyze how trader behavior (profitability, risk, volume, leverage) aligns or diverges from overall market sentiment (Fear vs Greed).  
The goal is to identify hidden trends or signals that could inform smarter trading strategies.

---

## 📊 Datasets
1. **Bitcoin Market Sentiment Dataset**  
   - Columns: `Date`, `Classification` (Fear / Greed)  
2. **Historical Trader Data from Hyperliquid**  
   - Columns include: `account`, `symbol`, `execution price`, `size`, `side`, `time`, `start position`, `event`, `closedPnL`, `leverage`, etc.

---

## ⚙️ Workflow
1. **Notebook 1:**  
   - Cleaning & preprocessing raw datasets  
   - Normalizing column names  
   - Converting timestamps to datetime  
   - Extracting date for merging  
   - Saving cleaned CSVs to `csv_files/`  

2. **Notebook 2:**  
   - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
   - Visualizing PnL, leverage, and volume against sentiment  
   - Generating insights from merged dataset  
   - Saving charts to `outputs/`  

---

## 📈 Key Insights
- Traders tend to **increase leverage and trade size during “Greed” phases**.  
- **Profitability improves slightly during “Fear” periods**, suggesting contrarian advantage.  
- Daily sentiment strongly correlates with **aggregate PnL distribution and volume spikes**.
